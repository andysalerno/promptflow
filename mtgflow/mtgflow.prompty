- Does the card cause your or the opponent to gain life?
- Does the card cause your or the opponent to draw a card?

## Response format
Your output should be json with the following format:
{ "youDraw": true, "youGainLife": false, "youLoseLife": false, "opponentDraw": false, "opponentGainLife": false, "opponentLoseLife": true }
